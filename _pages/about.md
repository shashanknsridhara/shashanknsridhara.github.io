Hi, I am Shashank, a Ph.D. student from Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California. My research advisor is [Prof. Antonio Ortega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K4bCJYcAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interest lies at the intersection of graph signal processing, multimedia data compression and differential geometry. I am particularly interested in developing scalable algorithms for 3D point cloud processing such as compression, graph construction, sampling and reconstruction.

<!-- An overaching theme that has been driving my research is the need for high performing, extremely simple and explainable systems. -->

## Background 
Prior to joining USC for my PhD, I obtained my Masters degree in Electrical Engineering at USC. Prior to that, I worked as a software engineer for 2 years at Allstate India.

I completed my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication from [Sri Jayachamarajendra college of Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSS_Science_and_Technology_University) (currently JSS Science and Technology University), where I worked with [Prof. C S Yogananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_S_Yogananda) and [Prof. Shreekanth T](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=R7cQfuMAAAAJ&hl=en).
